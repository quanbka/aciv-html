<p>In a blow to the Government’s strategy for balancing pressures on both the NHS and the economy, large parts of South East England were moved into Tier 3 restrictions this week following a steep increase in COVID-19 transmission rates. Though the Government continues to insist that the planned Christmas relaxation will go ahead as intended, in a break from previous unity, the devolved nations have recommended stricter application of the rules. Meanwhile, in a further indication that the crisis is far from over, the Chancellor has announced an extension to the furlough scheme until April 2021.</p>
<h3>London and surrounding areas moved to Tier 3</h3>
<p><strong>14th December: </strong>On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/health-and-social-care-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-14-december-2020" target="_blank">announced</a> that, due to an exponential rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases, London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire would be upgraded from Tier 2 to Tier 3 from Wednesday 16th December. While the latest review of tiers was not scheduled to take place until Wednesday, the Government and local authorities agreed on the need for urgent action in light of new evidence. The London weekly case rate is currently the highest regional rate in the country, with 225 cases per 100,000 people. As a result, the capital and much of the surrounding area change tier level three days before the wider review. </p>
<p>In making the announcement, the Government also stated that Public Health England (PHE) is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/phe-investigating-a-novel-strain-of-covid-19" target="_blank">investigating</a> a novel strain of COVID-19 which has been identified across the South East of England which might be contributing to the growth in transmission rates. As of 13th December, 1,108 cases with the new strain had been identified in areas with the highest increase in infection rate, although PHE is still attempting to understand whether there is a link between the new variant and the explosion of cases.</p>
<h3>Government announces outcome of latest tier review</h3>
<p><strong>17th December:</strong> On Thursday, the Health Secretary <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/review-of-local-restriction-tiers-17-december-2020" target="_blank">revealed</a> the outcome of the Government’s planned review of current tier restrictions. Following the end of the nationwide lockdown at the beginning of December, case rates were falling across the country, however the the Health Secretary stated that the latest data reveals cases are plateauing and even increasing in certain areas. The South East and East of England <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-list-of-local-restriction-tiers-by-area" target="_blank">suffered</a> the biggest blow, with six areas upgraded to Tier 3 due to an increase in infection rates. Despite significant efforts by local authorities to suppress the virus in the hard-hit North East of England, the area is to remain in Tier 3, as the Government concluded that case rates were not falling at a great enough rate to justify downgrading the region to Tier 2. Both Bristol and North Somerset were downgraded from Tier 3 to Tier 2, and Herefordshire was downgraded from Tier 2 to Tier 1 following a significant decrease in cases.</p>
<h3>Furlough scheme extended until April</h3>
<p><strong>17th December: </strong>Chancellor Rishi Sunak <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-and-loan-schemes" target="_blank">announced</a> on Thursday that the Treasury will extend the Job Retention Scheme until 30th April 2021, which will keep the furlough scheme in place for a month longer than previously planned. The Government hopes this will provide certainty for jobs and businesses as the crisis looks set to persist into 2021. Sunak confirmed he will also be extending the Government-guaranteed COVID-19 business loan schemes beyond January until the end of March. During his statement it was established that the
Budget will take place on 3rd March 2021, when the the Chancellor will outline the next phase of economic measures to tackle the virus and protect jobs.</p>
<h3>Confusion over Christmas restrictions</h3>
<p><strong>16th December: </strong>Following significant speculation over whether the Government and devolved administrations would move to tighten the rules, the Prime Minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/16/all-uk-nations-agree-not-to-change-christmas-covid-rules" target="_blank">stated</a> there was “unanimous agreement” between the UK’s four nations on the five day relaxation over the Christmas period. Questions around the current plan arose after scientists and MPs warned that the relaxed rules would cause a surge in coronavirus infections at a time when pressures on the NHS were already high. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove held a call with the leaders of the devolved nations regarding concerns, following which it was agreed to continue with the current plan to allow upto three households to mix over the five-day period. </p>
<p>However, The Prime Minister’s claims of unanimity have been questioned after both Wales and <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-festive-period/" target="_blank">Scotland</a> introduced their own caveats to the guidance, <a href="https://gov.wales/making-christmas-bubble-friends-and-family" target="_blank">advising</a> that Christmas bubbles should be limited to just two households. Northern Ireland will also enter a six week lockdown on Boxing Day.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s more lenient approach has been justified by concerns that harsh restrictions would largely be ignored, fuelling fears that  a one time “break of the rules” could encourage people to continue to do so in the future. While Johnson has been keen to stress unanimity, he will face significant scrutiny from the Labour opposition for his notably less stringent approach to Christmas should cases increase in the new year.</p>

<h3>Staggered return for schools in England after Christmas</h3>
<p><strong>17th December: </strong>Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/staggered-rollout-of-coronavirus-testing-for-secondary-schools-and-colleges" target="_blank">announced</a> that secondary schools and colleges in England will operate a staggered return in order to help roll out a round of free coronavirus testing from the first week of January. All non-exam year groups will be offered full-time remote education during the first week of term, with face-to-face teaching resuming from 11th January. It is hoped this will help slow the virus spread in the wider community as students return to school after the holidays.</p>
<h3>Vaccine rollout continues as NAO looks into contracts</h3>
<p><strong>17th December:</strong> Over 137,000 people in the UK have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-137000-people-in-uk-receive-first-dose-of-covid-vaccine-in-one-week" target="_blank">received</a> a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in its first week, as the Government rolled out the largest vaccination programme in British history. The majority of vaccines have been administered to priority groups including the over 80s, care home workers and NHS staff and GP-led centres have been vaccinating patients in England this week.</p>
<p>However, The  National Audit Office (NAO) has estimated that the UK has already spent £11.7bn In securing and administering coronavirus vaccines so far. The figure does not cover the costs of any future multi year programmes, and the report showed that many drugmakers had requested, and been granted, immunity in the event of legal action – meaning that the taxpayer could be liable in the event of a successful claim. The Public Accounts Committee stated that the Government was right to back a number of vaccine candidates, but that the accountability arrangements were “highly unusual”.</p>
<h3>Devolved Nations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>16th December:</strong> Wales will <a href="https://gov.wales/higher-level-restrictions-come-force-control-coronavirus" target="_blank">move</a> to alert level 4, the highest level of its traffic light system, with all non-essential retail to close at the end of trading on Christmas Eve. All hospitality premises will close from 6pm on Christmas Day and there will be tighter restrictions on household mixing from 28th December, after the five-day period of relaxed restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>17th December: </strong>Northern Ireland will <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-55349545" target="_blank">enter</a> a six-week lockdown from 26th December, with non-essential shops due to close at the end of trading. The first week of the lockdown will see severe restrictions with essential shops forced to close by 8pm each day. The measures will be reviewed by ministers after four weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other News</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>11th December:</strong> As of Monday 14th December, people who come into contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 are only <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-chief-medical-officers-statement-on-the-self-isolation-period-11-december-2020" target="_blank">required</a> to self-isolate for 10 days, compared to the previous 14-day quarantine. This also applies to travellers returning to the UK from territories which are not included on the UK’s travel corridor list.</li>
    <li><strong>17th December:</strong> The Government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-travel-corridors#history" target="_blank">updated</a> the UK travel corridor list to include Namibia, Uruguay and the US Virgin Islands. On 10th December it added Botswana and Saudi Arabia and removed the Canary Islands.</li>

<h3>Summary of UK COVID-19 Business support schemes</h3>
<p> The following rolling list of UK government business support measures announced in response to the Covid-19 pandemic is updated weekly and is accurate as of <strong><em>Thursday 17th December</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The UK Government has implemented a series of economic interventions aimed at supporting employees, employers and businesses through the uncertainty and potential loss of income resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. Some have been revised and extended since being announced.  </p>
<p>There is an official <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/financial-support-for-businesses-during-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank">web portal</a> with details on eligibility and how businesses can apply.</p>
<p><em><strong>Employment retention measures</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-job-support-scheme" target="_blank">Job Support Scheme</a></strong>: The Job Support Scheme is designed to protect viable jobs in businesses that are facing lower demand over the winter months due to Covid-19 and keep their employees attached to the workforce. The company will continue to pay its employee for time worked, but the cost of hours not worked will be split between the employer, the Government (through wage support) and the employee (through a wage reduction). This will ensure that employees earn a minimum of 73% of their normal wages overall, capped at earnings of £3,125. The scheme will open on 1 November 2020 and run for 6 months, until April 2021. On 22 October, the Government reduced the number of hours employees are required to work to qualify from 33% to 20% of their normal hours, rather than the previous 33%. Employer contributions will also be reduced from 33% for hours not worked, to 5%.</p>
<p>On 9 October, the Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/job-support-scheme-expanded-to-firms-required-to-close-due-to-covid-restrictions" target="_blank">altered</a> the Scheme to give further support to business’ required to close in local lockdowns. The Government will pay two thirds of employees’ salaries, to a maximum of £2,083, although their employer has the discretion to pay more than this if they wish. </p>
<p>As of 1 October, the Job Support Scheme has been <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/extension-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" target="_blank">postponed</a> with the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme extended as a result of national lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wages-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" target="_blank">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme</a>:</strong> Since March, employers have been able to claim 80% of their usual monthly wage costs for furloughed employees, limited to £2,500 per individual per month, plus the associated Employer National Insurance and minimum automatic enrolment employer pension contributions. Claims were originally able be made to cover the period 1st March – 31st October 2020. From August, furloughed workers have been able to work part-time, with employers sharing salary costs with the Government. Since August, for hours not worked by their employee, employers have been only be asked to cover National Insurance and employer pension contributions.</p>


<p>The scheme was planned to close on 31st  October, but this deadline has now been <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/extension-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" target="_blank">extended</a> until 31st March 2021. The extended scheme will continue to allow employers to continue to claim 80% of their usual monthly wage costs for furloughed employees. Employers do not have to have used the CJRS previously, but claims must relate to employees who have been on the payroll prior to 30th October.</p>





<p>The government published further guidance on 10th November on how to claim. The update stated that any claims after 1st November must be submitted by 11.59pm 14 calendar days after the month being claimed for. Additionally, 30th November is the final day employers can submit or change claims for periods ending on or before 31st October. The government also intends to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/extension-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" target="_blank">review </a>the scheme in January to see whether economic circumstances are improving enough to ask employers to contribute more. The Government updated advice on 19th November to provide clarity on valid excuses for missing the claim deadline. Employers must contact HMRC to ask about submitting a late claim.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/job-retention-bonus-ministerial-direction" target="_blank"><strong>Jobs Retention Bonus:</strong></a> The Government will pay employers a £1,000 bonus per employee if they bring someone back to work who was furloughed, on the condition that they are continuously employed through to January. The employee must be paid at least £520 per month on average, from November to the end of January, which is the equivalent of the lower earnings limit for national insurance contributions. Further details on the eligibility criteria can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/further-details-of-the-job-retention-bonus-announced" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In light of the extension of the Job Retention Scheme, the Job Retention Bonus will no longer be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/extension-to-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme/extension-of-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme" target="_blank">paid</a> in February, but a retention incentive will instead be paid at a time the Government deems appropriate.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-back-statutory-sick-pay-paid-to-employees-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank">Coronavirus Statutory Sick Pay Rebate Scheme</a>:</strong>
The Government will refund eligible Statutory Sick Pay costs to all employers with fewer than 250 employees. This applies to any claim arising as a result of Covid-19, including precautionary self-isolation, and is limited to two weeks per employee. The online service for reclaiming coronavirus sick-pay scheme is now live, with HMRC guidance on eligibility found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-back-statutory-sick-pay-paid-to-employees-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19" target="_blank">here</a>. As of 28th October, employers will be able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-back-statutory-sick-pay-paid-to-employees-due-to-coronavirus-covid-19#history" target="_blank">ask</a> employees for a “shielding note” from a doctor or health authority advising them to shield.</p>
<p>On 10th November, the provision of two weeks Statutory Sick Pay was extended to include those who have been advised by letter to shield due to clinical vulnerabilities should they be unable to work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme" target="_blank">Self-employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS):</a></strong>
Most self-employed workers qualify for a grant covering a percentage of monthly profits and earnings. The scheme is open to those with trading profits no greater than £50,000 and who have experienced a loss in earnings as a result of the COVID crisis. At least half of a claimant’s income must come from self-employment, and they must be trading when an application is made, or would be except for COVID-19 disruption. Two initial grants closed for applications on 13th July and 19th October 2020, and covered up to 80% and 70% of average monthly trading profits respectively.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-extension" target="_blank">extension</a> of this scheme, announced on 24 September, will provide two grants and will last for six months, from November 2020 to April 2021. Grants will be paid in two lump sum instalments each covering a three-month period. The first grant will cover a three-month period from the start of November until the end of January. The Government will provide a taxable grant covering 20 per cent of average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering 3 months’ worth of profits, and capped originally at £1,875 in total. As of 22nd October, the Government have <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-extension/self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-extension" target="_blank">doubled</a> the grant to a £3750 cap. The second grant will cover a three-month period from the start of February until the end of April. The Government will review the level of the second grant and set this in due course.</p>
<p>On 5 November, the Government announced it will provide a SEISS grant <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-extension/self-employment-income-support-scheme-grant-extension" target="_blank">extension</a>, with two further grants available for two three month periods covering November 2020 to January 2021 and February 2021 to April 2021. The initial grant will provide a grant equivalent to 80% of 3 months average monthly trading profits, capped at £7,500. As of 29th November, the online service to claim the third grant is open, with deadline for applications 29 January 2021.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-payment-for-people-self-isolating-in-highest-risk-areas" target="_blank">Self-isolation Low Income Payment</a>:</strong> From 28th September, the Government have made self-isolation a legal requirement, and introduced a £500 payment for those on lower incomes who cannot work from home of who have lost income as a result. Fines for those breaching self-isolation requirements <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-legal-duty-to-self-isolate-comes-into-force-today" target="_blank">start</a> at £1000, increasing to £10,000 for repeat offenders. Just under 4 million people who are in receipt of benefits in England will be eligible for this payment, which will be available to those who are required to self-isolate from 28 September.</p>
<p><em><strong>Business disruption financing measures</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.businesssupport.gov.uk/covid-19-corporate-financing-facility/" target="_blank">Coronavirus Commercial Financing Facility</a>:</strong> Introduced in March, The Bank of England’s new commercial financing facility is designed to support large companies of investment grade standing. It allows qualifying businesses to issue short-term debt of up to one-year maturity, which will be purchased by the Bank of England. The intent is to support short term liquidity, mitigating against cashflow disruption.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-notices/2020/term-funding-scheme-market-notice-mar-2020" target="_blank">Bank of England Term Funding Scheme</a>:</strong> In March, the Bank of England has introduced a new Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for small businesses financed by the issuance of central bank reserves. Over the next 12 months, the scheme will offer four-year funding of at least 5% of participants’ stock at interest rates at, or very close to, Bank Rate.</p>

As of 30 November, there are 27 lenders taking part in the scheme, including all main retail banks.

To incentivise them to lend, the Government – through the British Business Bank – is guaranteeing 80% of the value of a loan. On 30th July, the Government announced an extension of the scheme to include smaller businesses which have less than 50 employees and a turnover of less than £9m. Applications to the Scheme will close after 30 November. As of 30 November, there are 117 lenders participating in the scheme, including all main retail banks. On 17 December, the application deadline for the scheme was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-and-loan-schemes" target="_blank">extended</a> to 31 March 2021.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/small-businesses-boosted-by-bounce-back-loans" target="_blank">Bounce Back Loan Scheme:</a></strong> This is intended to support micro-businesses with short-term cashflow concerns as a result of the COVID crisis. Loans will be made available through accredited lenders to businesses with an annual turnover below £200,000 a year, capped at a maximum of £50,000. The Government will act as guarantor for 100% of the loan, increasing the chance of acceptance and ensuring that the loan does not need to be secured against personal assets. The Government will pay interest for the first year, with no repayments due during this period. On 17 December, the application deadline for the scheme was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-and-loan-schemes" target="_blank">extended</a> to 31 March 2021.</p>
